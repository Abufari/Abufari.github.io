Text can be **bold**, _italic_ or --strikethrough--

There should be some whitespace between paragraphs.

# This is Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. The text here can be as long or
short as you want and it does not make a huge difference. GitHub is hosting this
page.

## Welcome to Github Pages as header 2

> This is a blockquote following header 2
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3 comes along

```python
# this should be some python code
import zen
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,3])
b = np.zeros(3)
c = np.dot(a, b)
```

#### There are a lot of different headers if you can imagine

Which I think looks good.
